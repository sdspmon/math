## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the main goal of your research? 

The goal of my research is to develop a new framework for mathematics and logic that does not rely on traditional formal systems. Instead, it uses a hierarchy of types and mutual definitions to establish mathematical structures from within the system itself.

### Why do you think current systems are inadequate?

Current systems often rely on formal systems, axioms, and deductive reasoning, which I believe are limiting and disconnected from the actual processes used in the development of mathematical concepts. My approach seeks to provide a more flexible and intrinsic understanding of mathematical structures.

### How does your research relate to computer science and AI?
My work has direct applications in areas such as artificial intelligence, computer architecture, and programming languages. By providing a more structured way of representing logic and computation, this framework could offer new solutions in these fields, particularly for advanced tasks like natural language processing or complex system design.

### Can I collaborate with you on your projects?
I am open to collaborations, especially with researchers in mathematics, computer science, or AI. Please get in touch if you're interested in exploring potential synergies.

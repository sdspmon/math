I am a French mathematician currently living in Paris. My work stems from algebraic topology and revolves around the concepts of mathematical structure and language. 

# Research Overview

### For Algebraic Topologists
My work explores the foundations of mathematics and logic, developing a novel framework that avoids traditional formal systems. The focus is on a hierarchy of types and mutual definitions of objects, providing a new way of understanding mathematical structures.

Explore my papers and the technical details in the sections below.

### For Logicians
This work questions the usual distinctions between syntax and semantics and introduces a new approach to the logical foundations, building on category theory and algebraic structures.
Read about the implications for logic and mathematics, and how this framework might interact with existing theories.

### For Mathematicians

### For Everyone
This research proposes a new way of thinking about logic and mathematics, with potential applications in artificial intelligence, computer architecture, and programming language development. By rethinking the foundations, we open the door to new possibilities in computational theory.

# Current Projects
In addition to my foundational research, I am also working on projects in algebraic topology, programming language theory, and applications to AI and computing systems. These areas interconnect with my core research, expanding its impact beyond pure mathematics.
